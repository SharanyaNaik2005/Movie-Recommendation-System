ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System
This project builds a content-based movie recommendation system using Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Cosine Similarity. It suggests movies similar to a userâ€™s favorite movie based on genres, keywords, tagline, cast, and director.

ðŸ“Œ Features
Uses TF-IDF Vectorization to convert movie features into numerical form.
Calculates cosine similarity between movies.
Recommends Top 10 or Top 30 movies similar to the userâ€™s choice.
Handles partial or misspelled movie names using difflib.
Dataset sourced from YBI Foundation.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack
Python
Pandas & NumPy â€“ Data handling

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
Dataset: Movies Recommendation.csv
Columns used for recommendations:
Movie_Genre
Movie_Keywords
Movie_Tagline
Movie_Cast
Movie_Director

ðŸš€ How It Works
1. Load the dataset using Pandas.
2. Select important features (genre, keywords, tagline, cast, director).
3. Combine text data and apply TF-IDF Vectorizer.
4. Compute cosine similarity matrix between movies.
5. Take userâ€™s favorite movie as input.
6. Find the closest match using difflib.
7. Recommend Top 10 or Top 30 similar movies.
8.
